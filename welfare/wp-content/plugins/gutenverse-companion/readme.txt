Companion plugin for Gutenverse base themes

== DESCRIPTION ==

A companion plugin designed specifically to enhance and extend the functionality of Gutenverse base themes. This plugin integrates seamlessly with the base themes, providing additional features, customization options, and advanced tools to optimize the overall user experience and streamline the development process.

== Use of 3rd-Party Services ==

To improve the user experience, **Gutenverse Companion** may use the following third-party service:

=== Gutenverse Companion List Service ===

This service is used to fetch the list of companion demos for the Gutenverse theme. It allows users to view and select from various demo templates compatible with the theme they are using. The service retrieves a list of demos based on the current theme, enabling users to browse and install demos according to their preferences.

- **Service Endpoint:** `https://gutenverse.com/wp-json/gutenverse-server/v4/companion/list`
- **Purpose:** To fetch the companion demo list for the user’s current theme.
- **Usage:** The returned demo list helps users quickly find and install demos suitable for their selected theme, streamlining the process of setting up a new site or changing the look and feel of an existing one.
- **Circumstance:** This service is typically used within the **Companion Import Wizard** on the WordPress dashboard, where users can select and import demos directly from the interface based on the theme they have installed.
- **Data Sent:** The service only sends information about the **Gutenverse theme** currently in use by the user. No additional data is transmitted, ensuring that only relevant demos for that specific theme are returned.

This data is securely sent to our server at [gutenverse.com](https://gutenverse.com/). Rest assured, no information is transmitted automatically without your explicit consent.
